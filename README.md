There are 2 parts in this assembly: the base and the beam, which can be seen as follows<br />
Also, the support is simulated in SolidWorks: <br />

### The diptrace folder
Contains the schematic and pcb files.<br />
### The Final Project Pictures folder 
Contains figures in the final report.<br />
### The Parts List Emb.ods 
Contains a list of parts ordered, can only be opened with LibreOffice or other applications 
that can open .ods files.<br />

## The sumobot-final-project-report.pdf 
Is a pdf of - surprise- the sumobot final project report for Embedded Systems.<br />
